# Rust.ModLoader
A simple server-side script loader for Rust

**Note**: This is very early in development and isn't very useful yet. Contributions are welcome.

## Features
* Hooks into the game server dynamically using [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony)
* Scripts can implement hook methods which the mod loader calls
* Compiles and loads C# scripts automatically
