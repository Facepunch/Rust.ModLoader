# Contributing to this repository

## Getting started

Most of our work is determined based on what we need and using our best judgement instead of thorough planning. This
means we can't share any list of things to do because we don't have one.

The [issues](https://github.com/Facepunch/Rust.ModLoader/issues) list might have some outstanding things to complete,
but if not, then the best option is to try making mods and reporting what you can't do or what sucks. If there's a
bug then you can submit a PR, but for any large additions it's best to open a
[discussion](https://github.com/Facepunch/Rust.ModLoader/discussions) where everyone can discuss it before you start
working on it.
